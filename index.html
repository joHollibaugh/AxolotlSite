	<span id="dropCap">W</span>elcome! This page is dedicated to one of my favorite animals, the <em>Axolotl</em>! 
Here you will find a brief rundown of why I find this animal so interesting, as well as my sources of information.
	</p>
          
	<p>
	The axolotl, also known as the Mexican walking fish, is a type of salamander which can only be found in the lake complex Xochimilco near Mexico City. Despite their nickname, they are not fish, but amphibians. They are the only species of amphibian to reach adulthood without undergoing metamorphosis (ie. how a tadpole develops into an adult frog).  Read more about Axolotls on the <a href="axolotl.html" title="Go to the fact page">Axolotl fact page.</a>
	</p>
	<p>
	These grotesquely cute amphibians are often kept as pets, and are gentle enough to be handled by humans. In captivity, they can live to be 15 years old.  They spend their entire lives in the water, and never lose their gills like other amphibians. Axolotl's are <em>neotenic</em>, meaning they retain their juvenile features throughout their life cycle.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	
	One of the strangest things about this animal is its ability to regenerate. Most amphibians posess at least some regenerative ability, but the axolotl takes this to an extreme. They can regenerate entire limbs, bones, and even vertebrae! This, and the fact that they have very few natural predators help them to survive in the wild.
